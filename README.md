**Hi there 👋! Glad to see you here 😄**<br><br>
As you must have realised by now, Hi, I am Arpit! I am currently an undergraduate student from IEM, India. I have experience in Cloud Computing and have built next-gen FaaS applications.

🔭 I’m currently working on building mini applications on AWS. Feel free to check out my profile and yes, suggestions are always welcome ✨

💬 Ask me about anything I have written ⁠— we can have a nice chat virtually or if possible, we can meet over a cup of coffee ☕

📫 You can reach me on my [Portfolio](https://www.arpitsatnalika.in), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arpit-satnalika), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Arpit-Satnalika), or you can even drop me a mail at arpit.satnalika@protonmail.com

⚡ Fun fact — I like tea more than coffee. Also, I like Breaking Bad more than Dark and I seldom write too.
